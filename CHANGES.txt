Summary of changes to citeproc-js since version 1.2 release.

========================
Changes in version 1.2.1
========================

- Align disambig priorities with spec by default.

  The CSL Specification calls for year-suffix to be applied before
  disambiguate="true" conditions are tried. `citeproc-js` previously
  applied these in the opposite order by default, but from this
  version, default behavior is aligned with the spec.

  The previous behavior can be restored with the following setting
  on the `sys` object fed to the processor at instantiation:

    sys.prioritize_default_condition = true;

- A number of tests that are specific to `citeproc-js` have been
  moved from the `test-suite` CSL repository to citepro-js
  `fixtures/local`.
