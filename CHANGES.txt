Summary of changes to citeproc-js since version 1.0.0 release.


========================
Changes in version 1.0.1
========================

------------------------------------
Mishandled or unimplemented features
------------------------------------

- Return maxoffset and the value of second-field-align itself in the
  header of the return value from makeBibliography() when
  second-field-align is used.

- Correctly set the value of entry-spacing and line-spacing, providing
  for a default value of 1 for both attributes, and permitting them
  to be set to 0.

- Set position to subsequent rather than ibid on cites for which one
  or more notes stand between the current citation and the preceding
  partner.

- Implement and test the baseline value for vertical-align.

- Recognize first-reference-note-number as a variable attribute value
  on cs:if and cs:else-if.  Wake up locator attribute on cs:if and
  cs:else-if.

- Fix uppercasing of terms when rendered at first position, and
  prevent uppercasing otherwise.

- Use a space rather than space + comma as the delimiter preceding
  an implicit et-al term.

- Return entry_ids in the header returned by makeBibliography().  The
  entry_ids value is a list, in turn containing one list per entry
  (the nested list being necessary to provide for parallel citations
  picked up in the bibliography).

- Support for uncited items, via new updateUncitedItems() command.

-----------
Fine tuning
-----------

- Suppress issued year if it matches the volume number exactly.  This
  effect is needed for UK case cites.  It's an exception, so other
  content must take priority; the change comes out if it causes
  problems elsewhere.

- Fixes in node_names.js to make institutional names handling available in note styles.

- In what I think is a harmless divergence from the specification,
  return true for is-numeric for non-numeric variables that end in a
  number.  Some styles require adjustment of joins, such as the
  insertion of a comma, in this case.

- Taint items for a change in sequence number only if citation-number
  is used in the citation.

---------------------------------
Fixes to parallels detection code
---------------------------------

- Fix array overrun bug in parallel detection code.

- When the trailing year is quashed in a cite in initial position
  within a set, quash it also in the final partner.  Needed to
  handle public domain citations.

- Provide looser constraint on minimum variable content for parallels
  detection.  Provide for adding a constraint on item type.

- Eliminate am_master flag, and instead rely on the position of the
  rendered item under analysis within the cite set.  This works after
  eliminating and extraneous cite set list push operation that was
  causing it to fail.

-----------------
Internal bugfixes
-----------------

- Suppress registration of names that do not include a family name.

- Provide for the possibility that subsequent citation forms will not
  include any names, and therefore not produce disambiguation data in
  the registry.

- Avoid rendering of citation numbers when evaluating subsequent cites
  for disambiguation purposes, in node_text.js

- Fix a subtle bug in the rollback of added names, in
  disambig_cites.js.

- Companion changes in node_names.js and cmd_cite.js, to restore
  parameters based on subsequent-form disambiguation to the registry,
  after rendering a first-position cite.

- Fix bug caused by incomplete cs:choose node set as a helper for
  cs:substitute.

- Rename citationIdByItemId to citationsByItemId, and adjust code to
  set this list with pointers instead of IDs.  Leverage availability
  of citation pointers to get near-note conditional working.

-------
Cleanup
-------

- Delete tests which, if they had been correctly written, would have
  been invalid CSL.

- Fix tests involving et-al-subsequent-min and
  et-al-subsequent-use-first that were either incorrectly written or
  required a wrong result.

- Align abbreviation list keys with field names in tests.

- Cleanup and reorganization of code related to multi-lingual handling
  and abbreviations.

- Adjust near-note tests to use a simple boolean value on the cite
  supplement element of the item, rather than a note distance.

- Adjust tests to reflect correct lowercasing of ibid term when not at
  first position.

- Change tests to use a space rather than comma+space before et al.
