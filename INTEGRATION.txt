For integration, there will be two problems (at least).

(1) Sorting of citations.  The processor does not maintain state for
citations, and depends on the integration layer for position hints. It
currently performs sorting of citations immediately before rendering,
but this will break any positioning logic done in the integration
layer, which obviously needs to be done before cites are rendered.

Probably the simplest for Simon would be to separate sorting from
rendering, and have the integration layer call the processor first
with one interface (when updating the integration state entries), and
again with the other (when rendering citations).  This is close to
what the integration layer seems to do now (I guess that the sort
method on the citation objects in integration.js is in some way
delegated from the CSL processor).

(2) Parallel cites.  To get ibid working correctly with parallel
cites, the rendering method of the processor needs to be passed a
citation object from the integration layer, and modify the cite entry
for each cite processed to add a "parallel" flag on the second and
subsequent cites in any parallel series.  The positioning code in the
integration layer then needs to use this flag to set a "subsequent"
position on such cites, and otherwise skip over them for position
evaluation purposes.
