For abbreviation infrastructure, would need to be able to report out
three categories of variable, each in two parts (known abbreviation
vars and unknown abbreviation vars).

Would also need to be able to snarf a nickname for an abbreviation
set, and would need a function in sys for retrieving items
from the set, with a well defined interface.

terms:
  un-sales-number-label
  collection-number-label
  document-number-label
  document-number-authority-suffix

variables:
  un-sales-number
  document-number-authority

Need to build an abbreviations substitution mechanism to test this.
ECLAC examples need localized content for abbreviations as well.

Publisher should be digestible by names, so that we can properly
format cites to documents published by a subunit of a larger
organization.  Publisher is already in cs-names within the schema --
interesting, it would have blown up if used.  The only needed change
is in node_names.js, to convert plain string publisher data into the
form expected by names, so that the machinery will play well with
Zotero until publisher is promoted to a full and proper name field.

<names variable="author" delimiter=", ">
  <name delimiter=", " 
        form="short"
        et-al-min="3"
        et-al-use-first="2">
  </name>
  <institution first-max="1" 
               append-last="1" 
               institution-parts="short-long">
    <institution-part name="long"
                      if-has-short="true" 
                      prefix=" ("
                      suffix=")"/>
  </institution>
  <substitute>
    <text variable="publisher"/>
  </substitute>
</names>
