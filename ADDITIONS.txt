For abbreviation infrastructure, would need to be able to report out
three categories of variable, each in two parts (known abbreviation
vars and unknown abbreviation vars).

Would also need to be able to snarf a nickname for an abbreviation
set, and would need a function in sys for retrieving items
from the set, with a well defined interface.

terms:
  un-sales-number-label
  collection-number-label
  document-number-label
  document-number-authority-suffix

variables:
  un-sales-number
  document-number-authority

Question is whether document-number-authority belongs in there.
I think it probably does; it would be extremely awkward to
call on the acronym of an institutional author -- is there only
one author, do they have an acronym, are they listed as something
other than author, etc.  To be used only for identifiers that are
only useful for identifying documents within an institution
(like a specific court, or a company).  Numbers without an
aspiration to be global.  (Bruce is never going to buy this,
though.)

Need to build an abbreviations substitution mechanism to test this.
ECLAC examples need localized content for abbreviations as well.

<names variable="author" delimiter=", ">
  <name delimiter=", " 
        form="short"
        et-al-min="3"
        et-al-use-first="2">
  </name>
  <institution first-max="1" 
               append-last="1" 
               institution-parts="short-long">
    <institution-part name="long"
                      if-has-short="true" 
                      prefix=" ("
                      suffix=")"/>
  </institution>
  <substitute>
    <text variable="publisher"/>
  </substitute>
</names>
