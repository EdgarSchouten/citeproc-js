For abbreviation infrastructure, would need to be able to report out
three categories of variable, each in two parts (known abbreviation
vars and unknown abbreviation vars).

Would also need to be able to snarf a nickname for an abbreviation
set, and would need a function in sys for retrieving items
from the set, with a well defined interface.

terms:
  un-sales-number-label
  collection-number-label
  document-number-label
  document-number-authority-suffix

variables:
  un-sales-number

Need to build an abbreviations substitution mechanism to test this.
ECLAC examples need localized content for abbreviations as well.

<names variable="author" delimiter=", ">
  <name delimiter=", " 
        form="short"
        et-al-min="3"
        et-al-use-first="2">
  </name>
  <institution first-max="1" 
               append-last="1"
               order="normal"
               institution-parts="short-long">
    <institution-part name="long"
                      has-short-is="true" 
                      prefix=" ("
                      suffix=")"/>
  </institution>
  <substitute>
    <text variable="publisher"/>
  </substitute>
</names>
