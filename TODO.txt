# TODO

## Completion of feature set

- Erratum: raw date variables.  These should render as
  2000-12-01 when they appear as the argument to a text
  element.  Important for sort keys, as the raw variable
  is used all over the place in existing styles.

- Erratum: suppression of elements.  Doesn't seem to be
  any mechanism in place for restraining variables from
  rendering more than once in a citation.  The mark_output
  function should be extended to support this, with an
  appropriate hook in the output queue (?).
    (awaits test submission.  fbennett 2009-05-18)

- Erratum: groups as atoms within substitute span.  There
  will likely be a demand from CSL that raw top-level 
  groups in a substitute span behave as a single element.
  This will require that Configure set jump points on
  these elements, with extension functions to manage
  the jump and take note of successful evaluation.  Really
  hope this can be avoided, but I sense insistence in the
  wind.

- Handle position evaluation and back-references inside the 
  processor via the registry.  Zotero's own position evaluation 
  is currently broken, and although it may be fixed soon, demanding 
  complex evaluation like this is likely to lead to further trouble 
  in other applications.  If the processor receives the note number 
  from the application, the CSL processor can take care of the rest.
  First step will be to draw my positioning patches to
  integration.js into the citeproc-js code base, and figure out
  how to stitch it in via an extension to the registry.
  NOTE: this is on hold pending guidance from Zotero on (a) whether
  this functionality is desirable, and (b) whether it is possible
  to receive note numbers and predecessors from the plugins on
  each transaction.  In any case, not to be implemented until
  the specifics of the transaction protocol are known.

- Various options and special formatting attributes need to be
  implemented, none of which seem particularly scarey.
    (a very short list of these remain.  fbennett 2009-04-11)


## Possible work for Zotero deployment

- Anything on which I receive guidance.  No requests
  pending at present.

## Possible proposals for CSL

- Number could be a span element with per-atom formatting, 
  as has been done with names.  This will allow superscripting
  or ordinal suffixes, and maybe some other useful things.
    (pending.  fbennett 2009-04-13)

- Localized date formatting?
