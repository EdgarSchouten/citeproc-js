/**
 * A Javascript implementation of the CSL citation formatting language.
 *
 * <p>A configured instance of the process is built in two stages,
 * using {@link CSL.Core.Build} and {@link CSL.Core.Configure}.
 * The former sets up hash-accessible locale data and imports the CSL format file
 * to be applied to the citations,
 * transforming it into a one-dimensional token list, and
 * registering functions and parameters on each token as appropriate.
 * The latter sets jump-point information
 * on tokens that constitute potential branch
 * points, in a single back-to-front scan of the token list.
 * This
 * yields a token list that can be executed front-to-back by
 * body methods available on the
 * {@link CSL.Engine} class.</p>
 *
 * <p>This top-level {@link CSL} object itself carries
 * constants that are needed during processing.</p>
 * @namespace A CSL citation formatter.

<if locator="chapter"/> etc may not be implemented.  Needs a test.

Parallel snooping is probably not working on getSortKeys, and it needs
to do.  Where there is a second ibid backreference to a source within
the same cite, backreferencing will break, at least when the site is
first created.  The flagging of parallels to the external positioning
machinery has to be done in the sort, not in the rendering function.
No need to mangle the output in that case; but it needs to be snooped
and flagged.
