# TODO

## Completion of feature set

- Flip-flops to be cleared with Bruce D'Arcus and CSL group and
  implemented.
    (pending.  fbennett 2009-04-11)

- Numbers.  The current stuff for 0.8 needs to be
  implemented.
    (pending.  fbennett 2009-04-17)

- Handle position evaluation and back-references inside the 
  processor via the registry.  Zotero's own position evaluation 
  is currently broken, and although it may be fixed soon, demanding 
  complex evaluation like this is likely to lead to further trouble 
  in other applications.  If the processor receives the note number 
  from the application, the CSL processor can take care of the rest.
  First step will be to draw my positioning patches to
  integration.js into the citeproc-js code base, and figure out
  how to stitch it in via an extension to the registry.
    (pending fbennett 2009-04-17)

- Various options and special formatting attributes need to be
  implemented, none of which seem particularly scarey.
    (a very short list of these remain.  fbennett 2009-04-11)


## Possible work for Zotero deployment

- Deletion support for the registry.
    (pending.  fbennett 2009-04-11)

- Processor to report the full list of fields required to render
  any item in the compiled style, to permit the application to
  optimize database fetches?
    (pending.  fbennett 2009-04-11)


## Possible proposals for CSL

- Number could be a span element with per-atom formatting, 
  as has been done with names.  This will allow superscripting
  or ordinal suffixes, and maybe some other useful things.
    (pending.  fbennett 2009-04-13)

- Localized date formatting?
