6. Any other relevant information:

    Kunrei-shiki ("kunrei-style") romanization is taught in Japanese
    schools, and is more accessible (for _writing_ purposes) to native
    speakers of Japanese, because the form to be used in romanization
    does not depend on knowledge of English spelling conventions, but
    is instead derived in a systematic fashion from the Japanese
    logographic script used to express pronunciations natively.
