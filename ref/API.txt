Notes on the API commands available in citeproc-js

Things we need to be able to do.

== Commands

- These are commands initiated by the client (plugin).  These need to 
  be safe; they should require all information necessary to assure that 
  text in the client (plugin) agrees with registry content at the end of 
  the transaction.

  Add entries to the item registry
  Delete entries from the item registry

  Add entries to the position registry
  Delete entries from the position registry

  Validate item registry content
  Validate position registry content

  Render cite clusters
  Render the full bibliography
  
== Requests

  client in order to complete a top-level command.
