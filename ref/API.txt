Notes on the API commands available in citeproc-js

Things we need to be able to do.

== Commands

- These are commands initiated by the client (plugin).  These need to 
  be safe; they should require all information necessary to assure that 
  text in the client (plugin) agrees with registry content at the end of 
  the transaction.

  Initialization/general refresh
    list of all cite cluster data sets (basically implemented)

  Add entries to the item registry
    list of Items
  Delete entries from the item registry
    list of Item IDs

  Add entries to the position registry
    UID of cite cluster
    list of [Item + params]
  Delete entries from the position registry
    implicit in the operation above
    

  Reconcile item registry content
    list of all known item IDs
  Reconcile position registry content
    list of all known cite cluster UIDs in sequence (implicit delete)
  Reconcile position registry content (optional second phase)
    refresh duplicate cite cluster UIDs

  Render cite clusters
    ready and working
  Render the full bibliography
    ready and working
  
== Requests

- These are requests made by the processor to the
  client in order to complete a top-level command.
