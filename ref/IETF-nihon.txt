6. Any other relevant information:

    Nihon-shiki ("nihon-style") romanization dates from 1885.  It
    offers a strict one-to-one correspondence between the Japanese
    phonetic syllabary and the roman transliteration.  This makes 
    it rather difficult for non-Japanese speakers to recognize the
    correct pronunctiation of transliterated terms, but has the
    advantage that transliterations can be reversed to produce
    correct Japanese phonetic script.
