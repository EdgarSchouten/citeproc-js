The variable names listed below were globally assigned
in citeproc-js version 1.0.148. All global variable
assignments have been eliminated as of citeproc-js
version 1.0.155.

In the archive, the following commands can now be
used to check for global assignments in the main
body of the code (excepting the xmle4x.js and
xmldom.js modules, which must be inspected separately):

  ./test.py -B
  ./jslint.sh ./citeproc.js

I'll obviously be watching this more carefully going forward, but
it's probably a good idea to run this check against new processor
releases in advance of deployment, just to be on the safe side.
