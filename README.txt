This is an effort to implement a full-featured standalone CSL
processor in Javascript, for use by the Zotero project, and by other
sites and platforms that can benefit from a standard method of
formatting citation data.

Please see the manual, either in the ./manual subdirectory under the
name citeproc-doc.rst, or online at
http://gsl-nagoya-u.net/http/pub/citeproc-doc.html for details of this
program.

To run the test suite, the standard test fixtures must be added to this
archive.  To do so, enter the directory ./tests/fixtures, and issue
the following command:

  hg clone http://bitbucket.org/bdarcus/citeproc-test std

(Note the explicit target directory "std" following the repository
address.)

Enjoy!
