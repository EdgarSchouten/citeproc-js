Implementing parallel citations

Not sure if this will be a permanent feature of the processor, or a
workaround that goes away when Hierarchical Item References (HIRs?)
become available.  Try to do it neatly, it might be here for awhile.

This is a collapsing mechanism governed by the following rules:

(1) It does not depend on anything in CSL, and is always active;

(2) All cites in a series must have and attempt to render, at least,
a title, volume, container-title, and page;

(3) All cites in a series must have no discrepancies in rendered
variables other than volume, container-title, issue, and page;

(4) For all cites in a series except the first and the last, suppress 
all fields except volume, container-title, issue and page.  For the
first cite in a series, suppress all fields except initial creator, 
title, volume, container-title, issue and page.  For the last cite in 
a series, suppress initial creators and title.

A tall order, but clear enough to work.  Big step forward for legal
materials if we can do this.
